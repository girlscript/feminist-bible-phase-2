## What is Feminist Bible?

> The Feminist Bible is "**Made for all, by women.**"  

> It is an inclusive space for all. A place where we empathize, acknowledge, and promote diversity by creating an inclusive ecosystem powered by shared stores, culturally sensitive content, and equity-driven community philosophy.    

> Create a sense of belonging for all. 
Promote awareness by sharing the unheard voices of underrepresented and diverse people.  
Spread kindness, positivity, hope, curiosity, and fun in people's lives.

> Are you ready to share your story, participate in the positive and impactful movement, and be change-makers?

> Are you ready to embark on a memorable, purposeful, inspirational, and fulfilling journey? Come on, join [Maybelyn Plecic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maybelynplecic), [Rashmeet Kaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaurrashmeet27/), and the Feminist Bible team!
